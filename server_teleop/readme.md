## Installation Guide
1. Install Node.js and MongoDB
2. For insert the first user, you can use the **insert_data.js** script. Before executing it edit the file and insert safe credentials for the admin.
You can now execute the script using the command **node insert_data.js**; then remember to delete this file.
3. Install the server with **npm install**
4. Update the .env with right values. You need to create two certificates, even self signed is okay
